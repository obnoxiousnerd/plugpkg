## About

PlugPKG is a module management platform where you can publish your own modules and use them for your web and Deno projects.

**You can also call "PlugPKG" as "Plug"**

If you're confused what is a "module" that is being talked about, here is the definition:

> Module is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript/TypeScript/any other language files which can be reused throughout the application.

## Why this exists

If you're familiar with Node.js, you can simply think of `node_modules`, which just take about 2/3rd the space of your project, rest being your code. To simplify this, Deno takes another approach. It has its `import/export` ecosystem based on the Web standards, i.e either relative imports or URL imports, which saves a lot of disk space and frustation, resulting in a clean project structure as compared to a Node.js one. But sometimes, managing a lot of modules through URL imports can be time-consuming and cumbersome. Now, enter PlugPKG. Taking advantage of this ecosystem, you can write clean code that runs on Web/Deno/Both and be careless about module management using Plug. Everything you'd like to have in your project's module management list, is just a `plug` command away.

## Why are you using Node.js??

This is of course a temporary one, since Angular does not have support for Deno. And in the some-what distant future, we'll start [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) on this.

## Is this ready for my project??

Not for now. This project is still ultra-nightly, meaning there is a lot to do for this project to become the ideal tool for your project. But don't worry. You can also contribute to this project and help toward progress. Surely, it will be available for development purposes in some time.

## If you are a [philanthropist](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/philanthropist)

You can donate some money for this project on the developer's [patreon](https://patreon.com/obnoxiousnerd). Surely, this project will cost some because the devs will have to pay for service providers, Firebase and Vercel in this case.
